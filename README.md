# Summary

This is a demo BigCommerce app built from [Amplify BigCommerce](https://github.com/hatertron3000/amplify-bigcommerce) that can demonstrate the ability for a custom application to utlize the BigCommerce Shipping Provider API to provide shipping rates in checkout. Once this app is deployed, you can register it as a shipping provider for a BigCommerce store as described here: https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/shipping/shipping-provider-api

Screenshot of the rate management UI:
![screenshot of the rate management ui](https://public-github-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/carrier-service-ui.png)

This application manages the following AWS resources with Amplify CLI:

- IAM Roles
- CloudFormation Stack
- Lambda Functions
- API Gateways
- Cognito User and Identity Pools
- DynamoDB
- S3
- CloudFront

>*Disclaimer*
>----
> This is intended for demonstration purposes only. 
> * The UI is clunky
> * Only flat-rate shipping methods are supported
> * The [Validate Connection Options](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-provider-api/shipping-provider/validateconnectionoptions) endpoint is not implemented
> * And there are bugs.



# Installation

This application utilizes [AWS Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli) and [AWS Amplify JS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js) to deploy a serverless backend to AWS, with a React front end that you can run locally, or later build and publish to an S3 bucket behind CloudFront.

This application stores the BigCommerce Client Secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Amplify CLI does not provision the Secrets Manager resource, some of the steps will be performed in the AWS Console. Environment variables to refer to the Secret, as well as the BigCommerce Client ID, will be manually added as parameters for CloudFormation templates.

## Prerequisites

### Environment

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (recommended v10.16.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

*For Windows users, [Amplify recommends](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/react#installation) the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).*

### BigCommerce Store

If you do not already have one, you will need to create a BigCommerce store. If necessary navigate to [https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/) to sign up for a free trial store.


*Make sure your user account is the "store owner" account. Only the store owner can install draft apps like the one you're about to register. If you created the trial, your account is automatically the store owner.*

### BigCommerce App

This example will walk you through registering a [personal app](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/types-of-apps#types-of-personal_apps). To register a personal BigCommerce app, you will need:


- **App Name:** The name of your application.
- **Auth Callback URL:** The React app hosts the auth callback URL at /oauth
-- Example: https://example.com/oauth
- **Load Callback URL:** The React app hosts the load callback URL at /load
-- Example: https://example.com/load


You may use a URL such as https://localhost:3000/oauth to test against the local development server. You may update them later to instead use a permanent CloudFront URL, or a custom domain. You can use tools like [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify) or [Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-api-gateway.html) to apply a domain to your app.

1. Navigate to [https://devtools.bigcommerce.com](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) and log into your BigCommerce account
2. If necessary, log in with your store owner account.
3. Click the Create an App button
4. Enter your App Name, then click Create
5. Navigate to the Technical tab then enter the Auth Callback URL and Load Callback URLs

|Callback Type|URL|
|----|----|
|Auth|https://localhost:3000/oauth|
|Load|https://localhost:3000/load|
|Uninstall|Leave blank for now|

6. Take note of your Auth Callback URL to be used as the REDIRECTURL environment variable in a CloudFormation template.
7. Save the app
8. Click the View Client ID link to view your Client ID and Client Secret. Take note of those values for use in Lambda environment variables and storage in Secrets Manager respectively.
9. Take note of the App ID - it is the numeric value visible in the URL when you edit your appâ€™s details

For more information on BigCommerce apps, check out the [BigCommerce documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started).

|BCCLIENTID|Your BigCommerce Client ID|


### retrieveSecret CloudFormation

Edit *amplify/backend/function/retrieveSecret/parameters.json*, and make the following replacements:


|Key|Value|
|--|--|
|SECRETNAME|Your Secret's name in Secrets Manager (example: *bcSecret)*|
|SECRETKEY|They key from the key value pair in Secrets Manager (example: *client_secret)* |
|SECRETARN|The Amazon Resource Name of your Secret in Secrets Manager (example format: *arn:aws:secretsmanager*:{region}:{account}:*secret*:{secret-name}) |


## Initialize Amplify

In the project folder, run the following

```
amplify init
```

Follow the prompts to create a new environment, or use an existing one. Amplify CLI will create the AWS resources needed to deploy the application like a CloudFormation stack, and several IAM roles.


## Deploy Backend to Cloud

> *A note about security*
> ----
> To ensure the React client is only able to authenticate with the custom auth flow, be sure to enable Only allow Custom Authentication (CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY) for the app in the App Clients section of the Cognito User Pool console. See the Security Considerations section of the AWS blog post [Customizing Amazon Cognito User Pool Authentication Flows](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/customizing-your-user-pool-authentication-flow/).
> 
> Nevertheless, the [signUp()](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/api/classes/authclass.html#signup) method requires both a username and password. To ensure the password is not something easily guessable, the React client randomly generates a password between 16 and 256 characters including both alphanumeric and special characters.


### Local Testing

The longest part of the deployment is the CloudFront distribution. If you want to start testing as quickly as possible, consider removing the hosting resource and using the local development server for your Auth and Load Callback URLs. To remove hosting, run the following command in the project folder:

```
amplify hosting remove
```

Choose *S3AndCloudFront* and follow the prompts to remove the hosting resources locally. Then, run the following command to deploy the remaining resources to the cloud, and start the local development server:

```
amplify serve
```

Answer *Y* when prompted to create resources in the cloud


To test the uninstall flow, you will need to also complete the [Uninstall Callback URL](#uninstall-callback-url) steps below.


### Publish to Cloud


If you previously used `amplify hosting remove` to remove the hosting resources locally, you will first need to run `amplify hosting add` to add S3 hosting with CloudFront.


In the project folder, run the following

```
amplify publish
```

Answer *Y* when prompted to create resources in the cloud


Amplify will create a CloudFront distribution with HTTPS URLs for your S3 bucket. Then, it runs the React clientâ€™s build command, and upload the artifact to an S3 Bucket. Finally, the CLI will provide you with a URL where you can access the React Client. The URL is also available in *src/aws-exports.js* as aws_content_delivery_url. Alternatively, you can retrieve it from AWS console.


#### Update the PreSignup environment variables

Edit *amplify/backend/function/CognitoStoresPreSignup/parameters.json*, and make the following replacements:


|Key|Value|
|--|--|
|REDIRECTURL|Your app's new Auth Callback URL (example: *https://abcdef123456.cloudfront.net/oauth)|

#### Update Auth and Load Callback URLs
Use the */oauth* and */load* endpoints on the CloudFront URL to update the Auth and Load Callback URLs in BigCommerce:

1.  Navigate to [https://devtools.bigcommerce.com](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) and log into your BigCommerce account
2. If necessary, log in with your store owner account.
3. Click the Edit App button
4. Navigate to the Technical tab then update the Auth and Load Callback URLs
5. Click the Update and Close button

#### Uninstall Callback URL

1. Retrieve the uninstall callback URL. 
	* It can be found either [the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-call-api.html#apigateway-how-to-call-rest-api)...
	* ...or from *src/aws-exports.js* where it is the endpoint value for an object in aws_cloud_logic_custom (Example: https://abcd1234.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/environment). 
  

> If you retrieve the URL from the aws-exports.js file, you will need to
> append `/uninstall` to the URL.

2. Supply the Uninstall Callback URL to BigCommerce
	* Navigate to [https://devtools.bigcommerce.com](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) and log into your BigCommerce account
	* If necessary, log in with your store owner account.
	* Click the Edit App button
	* Navigate to the Technical tab then enter the Uninstall Callback URL
	* Click the Update and Close button

#### Request Shipping Rates URL
You will need to supply the [Request Shipping Rates URL](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-provider-api/shipping-provider/requestshippingrates) to BigCommerce so that BigCommerce can invoke the app to supply shipping rates. The sample app utilizes AWS API Gateway to create the endpoint. You can retrieve it the same way you retrieved the Uninstall Callback URL:

1. Retrieve the uninstall callback URL. 
	* It can be found either [the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-call-api.html#apigateway-how-to-call-rest-api)...
	* ...or from *src/aws-exports.js* where it is the endpoint value for an object in aws_cloud_logic_custom (Example: https://abcd1234.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/environment) named _carrierServiceApi_.

> If you retrieve the URL from the aws-exports.js file, you will need to
> append `/rates` to the URL.


## Usage

### Register the Carrier with BigCommerce

Follow the steps under _Sign Up_ to request BigCommerce to register the app as a shipping provider: [https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/shipping/shipping-provider-api#shipping_provider-signup](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/shipping/shipping-provider-api#shipping_provider-signup)

Note: The example app expects a checkbox/boolean Connection Option that indicates whether the app should return expedited rates. This connection option must be created when the app is registered with BigCommerce.

Example screenshot of _API Key_ and _Enable Expedited Shipping_ Connection Options in the BC control panel:
![https://public-github-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/carrier-service-connection-options.png](https://public-github-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/carrier-service-connection-options.png)

### App Installation Flow
To authorize the app to access the BigCommerce API on behalf of a store, install the app in the BigCommerce store:
1.  Log in to your BigCommerce store. If you donâ€™t have one yet, [sign up for a trial](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/). Make sure to use the same email address that you used to register the app at [https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/). 
2.  Navigate to Apps > My Apps > My Draft Apps
3.  Click your appâ€™s name
4.  Click the Install button, and confirm installation

At this point, BigCommerce creates an iframe in the control panel that sends the Auth request to the Auth Callback URL. The Install component at that route should present the signup form, then initiate signup with Cognito. If you encounter an error, try checking the following places for more information to help you debug:

-   the browserâ€™s JS console
-   CloudWatch logs for the PreSignup Lambda function
-   Consider adding support to run the standalone shell for [react-dev-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools)  
The example app requires the user to close the app, then relaunch it. Thatâ€™s because the successful signup request creates the user record in Cognito, but it does not grant the user the tokens it will need to access the appâ€™s backend later. The app requires a Load request from BigCommerce to initiate the custom auth flow, and grant the tokens. The Load request is triggered when the user clicks the appâ€™s icon in their BigCommerce control panel.

### Enable the Shipping Provider
Once the carrier has been registered with BigCommerce and the app is installed, a new shipping method will be visible in the BigCommerce control panel when editing a shipping zone under from _Store Setup > Shipping_ under _Real Time Shipping Quotes_:

![https://public-github-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/carrier-service-shipping-zone-settings.png](https://public-github-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/carrier-service-shipping-zone-settings.png)

Use the _Connect_ button to enable the carrier, configure connection options, and test the rate request endpoint. 

BigCommerce also provides APIs to manage shipping zones and configure shipping methods. This example app does not integrate with those APIs. Read more in the [BigCommerce documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api).

### Custom Auth Flow
1.  Log into the BigCommerce store
2.  Click Apps, then click the Appâ€™s icon  
	 * Note: If the appâ€™s icon is not present in the Apps menu, check to ensure the app is installed.  
* At this point, the browser sends the Load Callback request to open the React client in an iframe. The React client should receive the request, and initiate the custom auth flow in Cognito.
* If you receive an error, check the CloudWatch logs for the Define Auth Challenge, Create Auth Challenge, and Verify Auth Challenge Response Lambda functions for more information.

3.  Confirm the UI is rendered
4.  Click the Get Store Information button
* At this point, the React client should use the API.get() method to invoke the appâ€™s API with the identity and access tokens supplied by Cognito. If you receive an error from the API, check the CloudWatch logs for the bcApiClient and bcApiLambda functions.
5.  Confirm the React client receives the storeâ€™s information from the BigCommerce API

### Configure Rates
Once you are able to launch the UI in the BigCommerce control panel, you can add, remove, and edit the flat-rate shipping methods returned by the app.

### Uninstall  Flow

1.  Log in to your store, and navigate to Apps > My Apps
2. Click the Uninstall link for your app
* At this point, BigCommerce will send an uninstall request to the URL you supplied. You can use AWS console to check the user pool in Cognito and the table in DynamoDB to ensure the storeâ€™s user and BigCommerce Access Token have been deleted. If they arenâ€™t deleted after uninstalling the app, check the CloudWatch logs for uninstall Lambda. If there are no log streams for the uninstall Lambda, check that the Invoke URL for the uninstall API matches the Uninstall Callback URL provided to BigCommerce.
